we evaluate the influence of environmental conditions at the catchment and local spatial scales on the structure and species richness of stream fish assemblages in the Brazilian Cerrado. We tested the hypothesis that land use in the catchment determines the structure of fish assemblages, since it affects local stream conditions that represent the main environmental predictors of fish species assemblage in tropical streams (e.g., Dala-Corte et al., 2016; Molina et al., 2017; Alvarenga et al., 2021). Given that anthropic land uses in a given catchment will modify the environmental conditions in its streams (Allan, 2004), we expect land use for pasture and agriculture to have a negative effect on fish species richness via through alterations of local conditions, such as increased turbidity, suspended sediment (total suspended solids) and stream water temperature. In contrast, we expect that an area with a land-use policy that retains native vegetation will have a positive effect on fish species richness because of the presence of submerged branches and trunks and coarse particulate organic matter contribute to increased habitat diversity, refugia, and resource availability in these streams.
